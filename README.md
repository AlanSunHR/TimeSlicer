# TimeSlicer
A simple package to slice time into intervals, so that code snippets can be executed in a fixed frequency, which might be useful for real-time robot control(but you should not expect to control in semi-millisecond level).

## Installation
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ time-slicer==0.0.3
```
## Basic Usage
Please check tests/test_slicer.py for basic usage
